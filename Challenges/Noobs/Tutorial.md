# Welcome to Zo Programming Language

Hi, welcome, my dear hacker. For more info, let's get started with the basics, shall we?

As you know, all computers connected to a network have an IP. Well, in this case, each computer will be identified with an IP, that, you later, are gonna use for breaking through the security issues. For know, just focus on creating your first `.zo` program.

# Getting IP from a server

For getting an IP, you have to be sure to activate your VPN program. To do that, you'll have to import the pre-installed library called `server-vpn`. This was installed by the package we installed before (check the `Readme.md` file at the beginning of this repository). Let's see how do we import that package into our program.

```
from server-configuration read server-vpn
```

With that single line of code, we import the `server-vpn` in our program. Now, let's try to connect the VPN private server to our computer. For that, you'll need to learn a few things on how it is structured the servers in this `HackerZO` community.

# Understanding the server's configuration and structure

In this new world, servers have a different configuration structure.
