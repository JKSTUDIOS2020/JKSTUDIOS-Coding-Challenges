# Welcome

Hello, coder! Let's see... You've come here because someone told you or you are just here to entertain yourself? Well, the best answer would be that you re for coding and for overpass new challenges. This is not gonna be the same challenges as always, these are gonna be challenges about hacking, real hacking. And for that, you need to be very alone and start powering up your amazing _Coding Brain_. Let's review some rules that you'll need to take into account...

# Rules

1. Be **alone**. This is the most important part of this hacking journey. If someone knows about what are you doing, well, you are gonna end in `HackerHell`. I'll explain this later.

2. In this challenges there are not gonna be any solutions online, so don't worry. This is gonna be an invented programming language which I have invented (it's not runnable, but I will make it soon to be so). For now, just focus on completing all the challenges (which I have to check individually) and winning `HackerBits`. `HackerBits` are like money. If you have a lot of money, you can buy solutions and pass contests with any difficulty. But that's gonna be later on, you noob, 'cause you have a long journey to get there.

3. Don't insult other hackers. This is a very important point. If you insult or say any inappropiate thing of other's code, you will be automatically banned from this GitHub repository.


# `HackerZO` - The Programming Language

Welcome to `HackerZO`, the main programming language that you are gonna be using in this journey. For that, you have to get ready and start turning on your computer. Start by opening one of your favourite code editors and create a new file called `test.zo`. ... ... Done? Great, now let's start by teaching you the basics of the new hacking programming language.

# Basics

As you know, hacking has converted a very important tool in our lifes. With hacking, we can hack bank accounts, read hidden information, stole money, _etc_. But, YOU are gonna do more. You are gonna be hacking the Google Company without blinking and you are gonna be hacking rich people personal accounts. For that, let's start seeing how you can initialize your private server and how you can start by hacking an IP.

# Getting your server

If you don't know, a server is a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network. Remember: servers can also be hacked. You need to also learn how to securely protect your server and how to prevent itself and automate it from unknown attacks.

# Setting it all up

Let's start by opening this `test.zo` file and start coding it. The firts thing you need to do is give a name to your server. Advices:

- Give a name which **NOBODY** has it yet. I'm gonna be listing in an other file all the servers names.
